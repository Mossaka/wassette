# Getting Started with Wassette

This tutorial will guide you through installing Wassette, loading your first WebAssembly component, and understanding the basics of the security model.

## Prerequisites

- A terminal/command line interface
- An MCP-compatible AI agent (VS Code with Copilot, Cursor, Claude Desktop, etc.)
- Basic familiarity with command line operations

## Step 1: Installation

Choose the installation method for your platform:

### Linux and macOS

Use the installation script for the quickest setup:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/wassette/main/install.sh | bash
```

This script will:
- Detect your platform automatically
- Download the latest `wassette` binary
- Install it to your `$PATH`
- Verify the installation

### macOS with Homebrew

If you prefer package managers:

```bash
brew tap microsoft/wassette
brew install wassette
```

See the [Homebrew installation guide](./homebrew.md) for more details.

### Windows with WinGet

For Windows users:

```powershell
winget install Microsoft.Wassette
```

See the [WinGet installation guide](./winget.md) for more details.

### Nix

For reproducible environments:

```bash
nix profile install github:microsoft/wassette
```

See the [Nix installation guide](./nix.md) for more details.

### Verify Installation

After installation, verify that Wassette is available:

```bash
wassette --version
```

You should see output showing the installed version.

## Step 2: Configure Your AI Agent

Wassette works as an MCP server that connects to AI agents. You need to register Wassette with your agent of choice.

### Visual Studio Code

For VS Code users with GitHub Copilot, click the installation badge:

Or use the command line:

```bash
code --add-mcp '{"name":"Wassette","command":"wassette","args":["serve","--stdio"]}'
```

### Other Agents

For detailed setup instructions for Cursor, Claude Desktop, Gemini CLI, and other agents, see the [MCP Clients Setup Guide](./mcp-clients.md).

## Step 3: Start Wassette

Start the Wassette MCP server. The method depends on your agent configuration:

### For Direct Testing (HTTP Mode)

To test Wassette independently:

```bash
wassette serve --sse
```

This starts Wassette with Server-Sent Events transport on `http://127.0.0.1:9001/sse`.

### For Agent Integration (Stdio Mode)

Most AI agents will automatically start Wassette when needed, using stdio transport. If you're manually starting it:

```bash
wassette serve --stdio
```

## Step 4: Load Your First Component

Now that Wassette is running and connected to your AI agent, let's load a simple component to teach your agent how to tell time.

### Using Your AI Agent

In your AI agent's chat interface, type:

```text
Please load the time component from oci://ghcr.io/yoshuawuyts/time:latest
```

The agent will:
1. Call Wassette's `load-component` tool
2. Download the component from the OCI registry
3. Load it into the Wassette runtime
4. Make the component's functions available as new tools

### What Just Happened?

- **OCI Registry**: WebAssembly components can be stored in OCI (Open Container Initiative) registries, just like container images
- **Dynamic Loading**: Wassette loaded the component at runtime without requiring a restart
- **Security Sandbox**: The component runs in a secure WebAssembly sandbox with no access to your system by default

## Step 5: Use the Component

Now that the time component is loaded, you can ask your agent to use it:

```text
What is the current time?
```

Your agent will:
1. Recognize it needs time information
2. Call the `get-current-time` function from the time component
3. Return the result to you

Example response:
```
The current time is January 31, 2025 at 10:30 AM UTC
```

## Step 6: Explore Available Components

Wassette includes a component registry with pre-built components you can discover:

```text
What components are available to load?
```

Your agent will call the `search-components` tool and show you a list of available components, such as:

- **Weather Server**: Fetch weather information for locations
- **Time Server**: Get current time and date
- **File System Tools**: Read and write files with controlled permissions
- **HTTP Client**: Make HTTP requests to specified domains

## Step 7: Understanding Security

One of Wassette's key features is its security model. Let's explore it.

### Viewing Permissions

Check what permissions a component has:

```text
Show me the policy for the time component
```

Your agent will call `get-policy` and show you the component's permissions. Initially, most components have minimal or no permissions.

### Granting Permissions

Components need explicit permissions to access resources. For example, if you load a weather component that needs network access:

```text
Grant the weather component permission to access api.openweathermap.org
```

This grants network access to that specific domain only. The component cannot access other network resources.

### Permission Types

Wassette supports several permission types:

- **Storage**: File system access (read/write to specific paths)
- **Network**: Network access (specific hosts only)
- **Environment Variables**: Access to specific environment variables
- **Memory**: Resource limits (maximum memory usage)

## Step 8: Load a Local Component

If you're developing your own components, you can load them from local files:

```text
Please load the component from file:///path/to/my-component.wasm
```

This is useful for:
- Testing components during development
- Using custom internal components
- Iterating quickly without publishing to a registry

## Common First-Time Issues

### Component Won't Load

**Problem**: Error loading a component from OCI registry

**Solutions**:
- Check your internet connection
- Verify the OCI path is correct
- Ensure the registry is accessible (not behind a firewall)
- Try the `--verbose` flag for detailed error messages

### Agent Can't Find Wassette

**Problem**: Agent reports "Wassette not found" or similar

**Solutions**:
- Verify `wassette` is in your PATH: `which wassette`
- Restart your AI agent after installation
- Check the agent's MCP configuration file
- Try running `wassette serve --stdio` manually to test

### Permission Denied Errors

**Problem**: Component fails with "permission denied" errors

**Solutions**:
- Check component permissions with `get-policy`
- Grant necessary permissions explicitly
- Remember: Wassette uses deny-by-default security
- Review the component's documentation for required permissions

## Summary

Congratulations! You've learned to:

âœ“ Install Wassette on your system  
âœ“ Configure it with your AI agent  
âœ“ Load WebAssembly components from registries  
âœ“ Use components through your agent  
âœ“ Understand Wassette's security model  
âœ“ Manage permissions for components  

Wassette provides a secure, flexible way to extend AI agents with WebAssembly components. The combination of sandboxed execution and fine-grained permissions makes it safe to run untrusted code while maintaining full control over system access.

Happy building! ðŸš€
