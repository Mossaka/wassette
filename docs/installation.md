- Git

### Build Steps

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/wassette.git
cd wassette

# Build the release binary
cargo build --release

# The binary will be at target/release/wassette
# Copy it to your PATH

```

You should see output showing the version number and available commands.

## Next Steps

Once Wassette is installed, you can:

1. **Configure your MCP client** - See the [MCP Clients guide](./mcp-clients.md) for setup instructions for Cursor, Claude Code, VS Code, and other clients
2. **Try the quick start** - Follow the [Getting Started guide](./getting-started.md) to load your first component
3. **Explore examples** - Check out the [Examples](./examples.md) to see what you can build

## Troubleshooting

### Command Not Found

If you get a "command not found" error after installation:

1. **Check your PATH**: Ensure the installation directory is in your PATH
   ```bash
   echo $PATH
   ```

2. **Reload your shell**: Close and reopen your terminal, or run:
   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc for zsh
   ```

3. **Manual PATH setup**: Add to your shell configuration file:
   ```bash
   export PATH="$PATH:/usr/local/bin"
   ```

### Permission Denied

If you get permission errors:

- On Linux/macOS: Use `sudo` for system-wide installation
- On Windows: Run PowerShell as Administrator
- Alternative: Install to a user directory that doesn't require elevated privileges

### Platform-Specific Issues
