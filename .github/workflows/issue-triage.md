# label issue

label the current issue #${{ github.event.issue.number }}.

Select appropriate labels for the issue from the provided list.

Retrieve the issue content using the get_issue tool. If the issue is obviously spam, or generated by bot, or something else that is not an actual issue to be worked on, then do nothing and exit the workflow.
